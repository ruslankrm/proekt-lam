                The new Lamborghini flagship has a full 
                monocoque. The entire occupant cell, 
                with tub and roof, is one single physical 
                component. This ensures extreme 
                rigidity and thus outstanding driving 
                precision, as well as an extremely high 
                level of passive safety for the driver and 
                his passenger. The entire monocoque 
                weighs only 147.5 kilograms (325.18 
                lb).The monocoque, together with the 
                front and rear Aluminium frames, 
                features an impressive combination of 
                extreme torsional stiffness of 35,000 
                Newton meters per degree and weighs 
                only 229.5 kilograms (505.9 lb).
